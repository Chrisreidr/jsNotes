      <h3 class="center">Sources of Data</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>From the program itself:</strong> Data written directly in the
          source code. Such as status messages that will be displayed on the
          webpage based on user actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>From the UI:</strong> Data input from the user interface
          (webpage) or data written in the DOM
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>From external sources:</strong> Data fetched for example from
          a web API (Apllication Programming Interface). Used to get data from
          other web applications. Usually in the form of JSON, which is
          esstntially a long sting of text that can be converted to Javascript
          objects because of the same formatting as Javascript objects and
          arrays.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are usually collections of data (conversion rates, movie, recipes,
        numbers, etc.) that need to be stored somewhere. We store them in one of
        the four built-in data structures.
      </p>
      <h3 class="center">When to use each Data structure</h3>
      <ul>
        <h4 class="center">Arrays and Sets</h4>
        <p>
          Simple list of values. Simply contain values without any description.
        </p>
        <li>
          <strong>Array:</strong> When you need <strong>ordered</strong> list of
          values (might contain duplicates) or when the data needs to be
          manipulated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set:</strong> Use with unique values when
          <strong>high-performance</strong> (10 times faster searching for or
          deleting an item than arrays) is necessary and to remove duplicates
          from arrays.
        </li>
        <h4 class="center">Objects and Maps</h4>
        <p>Key value pairs. Keys are used to describing each value</p>
        <li>
          <strong>Object:</strong> Used before ES6. Easier to write and access
          values via the dot (.) and bracket ([]) notations. Use when you need
          functions (methods) as values are required. Also allows us to use the
          <strong>.this</strong> keyword to access properties of the same
          object.<br />
          Always use function expression as methods in objects and
          <strong>NOT</strong> arrow functions because it cannot have its own
          <strong>this</strong> keyword and will returned undefined. But it can
          inheret the <strong>this</strong> keyword from its parent scope.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Map:</strong> Offer better performance, keys can have any data
          type, are easy to iterate and compute the size of. Use when you simply
          need to map values and keys that are not strings
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="center">Sets</h1>
      <p>
        Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the
        elements of a set in insertion order. A value in the Set may only occur
        once; it is unique in the Set's collection.
      </p>
      <h1 class="center">Maps</h1>
      <p>
        Maps are data structures used to map values to keys. Like in objects,
        data is stored in the key value pairs in maps. In objects keys are
        bascially always strings. While maps can have any type of key including
        arrays, objects, or other maps.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>const x = new Map()</strong> - Begin by creating an empty map,
          then simply add the key and value via the set method. It returns the
          value immediately, meaning you can chain more set method to add
          multiple keys and values at once.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>x.set ()</strong> - Begin by creating an empty map, then
          simply add the key and value via the set method. It returns the value
          immediately, meaning you can chain more set method to add multiple
          keys and values at once.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>x.get ()</strong> - We are able to revrieve any value and
          property from the maps by passing in the name of the key
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>x.delete ()</strong> - Will delete the key and value from a
          map of the key specified in the paranthese
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>x.size ()</strong> - Returns the number of elements in a map
          object
        </li>
        <li><strong>x.clear ()</strong> - Removes all elements from a map</li>
        <li>
          <strong>x.values ()</strong> - We are able to revrieve all values from
          the maps by leaving the paranthese empty
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="center">Maps: Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        We can also create a new map already populated with values by creating
        an array containing individual arrays with a key and value pair. Which
        can also be accomplished by calling <strong>Object.entries()</strong> on
        an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to convert an object to a map, type
        <strong
          >const objectToMap = new Map(Object.entries(objectProperty));</strong
        >
      </p>
